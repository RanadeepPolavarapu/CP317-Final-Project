WLU CP 317 Final Project

#####By: Ranadeep Polavarapu, Bruno Salapic, Lee Glendenning, Ryan Burke

Checklist
=========
Requirements
------
*  [✖] Choose a project idea by Thursday Oct 23.   

<!-- 
Bonus
------
*  [✖] Touching a point P on the screen triggers a bullet firing from the center of the hero to the direction of P, provided P is not in the hero’s icon. You should programmatically destroy the bullet when it hits the screen edge, for otherwise keeping track of a large number of bullets will slow down your game and possibly crash it. A goblin is caught when it is hit by a bullet.
